# Plan Your Trip!

A road trip planning web application

## Concept

The goal of this project was to create a simple and user friendly road trip planning application. The application would take user starting and destination points as input, display the route on Google Maps, and estimate the total gas price for a one way trip. The application would also allow the user to select way points along the route and show the gas price at the nearest gas station to the selected way point. The application would also make a suggestion for a hotel deal at the destination and display a link that the user could follow to make their hotel selection. Finally, the user would be able to save trips that they have entered to their personal account and be able to retrieve their trips by logging into the application at a later time.

## Application

Please look around and save some trips to your personal account! Note the additional features that this application offers:

* Mobile responsiveness
* User authentication via a number of federated identity providers (Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.)
* Ability to save and re-visit trips
* Interactive map

## Future Work

Future features that are being considered for this application are integration with additional travel sources such as flight APIs to allow the user to compare the cost of flying as opposed to driving to their destination. Another feature that is being considered is integration with APIs providing information on specific attractions or restaurants around the destination point to allow for a complete trip planning experience.

Happy traveling!
